# UserAuthenticationPrototype
This is an a sign up and sign in app created by me. It implements react native, expo, firebase and firestore to create an app where a email and password is stored in the databse and then used for authentication.

# How to test it
1. You need to download the expo go app on your phone.
2. Then type "npx expo start -c" in the command prompt.
3. It will show a QR code.
4. Scan the QR code usin expo go and the app should appear.

# Caution
Make sure you are on the same wifi network on your laptop and phone for it to work
